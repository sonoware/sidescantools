# SidescanTools
Welcome to SidescanTools, an open-source software to read and process data from side-scan sonar instruments.
This tool can be used to create high-resolution 2D images of the sea floor.
The data can be processed to reduce noise, apply slant-range correction and gain normalisation on a set of side-scan files.
They can then be exported as `.geotiff` or simple `.png` files.
As of now, SidescanTools can process and read data from two formats:
- .jsf: open file format by EdgeTech
- .xtf: cross-platform readable file format

# Main Processing Steps
1. Detect **bottom line** in waterfall view (required for any following processing step).
2. **Slant-range correction**: Calculate ground range by projecting slant ranges onto bottom, assuming flat seafloor.
3. **Empirical gain normalization** (EGN) is used to correct for intensity changes by angle and distance.
   EGN sums and averages amplitudes of all pings over all loaded files to correct intensity.
   Note that this only works for files from the *same* instrument.
   A good approach is one EGN table per survey/day and per instrument.
4. Export data as **georeferenced image** to view on a map.

# Issues and Planned Features
The following features are still under development and will be improved in future releases:
- **Georeferencing** currently uses [gdal](https://gdal.org/) and `polynomial 1` which preserves parallel lines -- _custom georeferencing to be implemented_
- **Data processing** currently freezes the GUI, information about the current state is only shown in the console -- _background processing to be implemented_
- **Loading XTF/JSF files** always reads the entire file -- _loading only headers to show meta information while keeping the GUI responsive to be implemented_
- **Recommendations** _for downsampling and processing based on loaded data to be implemented_
- _Implement a standard case per possible imported datatype for optimal visibility of objects in the images_

# Getting Started
1. Make sure to have Python 3.11 - 3.13 installed. SidescanTools may or may not work with other versions of Python.
2. Clone this git repository
3. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`.
   Using a virtual (conda!) environment is recommended.
   Currently packages are listed without minimum version.
   - Recommended: Use anaconda or miniconda and install gdal using: conda install -c confa-forge gdal=3.11
   - If you do not use conda and are on Windows and have trouble installing GDAL, check [cgohlke's wheels](https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases) (not recommended!)
   - On Linux, if not using conda, you may need to install your system's gdal package (e.g., `apt install libgdal-dev` or `yum install libgdal-dev`)
4. Start GUI by typing `python main.py`


# Usage
In the following all GUI elements are explained in more detail.

## Add Sidescan Data
- Add sidescan data by pressing `Add XTF/JSF` in the top left panel

## Bottom-line Detection
- `Bottom-line Detection` initiates the bottom-line detection window
- `Chunk Size`: Number of pings in a single view
- `Default Threshold`: Threshold used on normalized ping data to make data binary for bottom detection
- `Downsampling Factor`: Integer number to reduce samples per each ping (Data is decimated using this factor)
- Tick `Convert to dB` to convert data to decibels instead of intensities

## Bottom Line Detection Window
- The selected file is read and divided into chunks.
  An initial depth detection is done for the full file which can be adjusted for each frame/chunk.
- Threshold and side strategies that can be selected: `Each Side Individually`, `Combine Both Sides`, `Only Use Portside`, `Only Use Starboard`
- The depth detection result can be saved or loaded to a `.npz` file.
  Files need so be saved to the current working directory to be accessible for the next processing steps.

## Slant-range Correction and Gain Normalisation
- `Vertical Beam Angle` (only relevant if internal depth is unknown or shall be omitted): Horizontal angle by which the instrument is tilted (usually found in the manual)
- `Nadir Angle` (only relevant if internal depth is unknown or shall be omitted): Angle between perpendicular and first bottom return (usually need to be estimated, leave 0Â° if unsure)
- Tick `Internal Depth` if the flying alitude of the side scan instrument is known & has been logged correctly
- `Chunk Size`: Number of pings per chunk to calculate EGN table and use for waterfall image generation
- `Apply Downsampling`: Use downsampling factor as defined in bottom line detection. If unchecked, data will only be downsampled for bottom line detection but not for final image/geotiff generation.
- `Remove Watercolumn`: Removes watercolumn prior to slant range correction and EGN calculation
- `Active Multiprocessing`: Activate multi-threading
- `Number of Workers`: Set number of parallel processing workers
- `Generate EGN table`: Initiates EGN table generation. All files loaded in the project that have bottom line information available will be processed. For each sonar file, the required information is saved to individual EGN info files. In a last step, all these info files are combined into one EGN table that can be applied to gain normalise all data of this side scan sonar type (see next step). This process needs quite some time (check console outputs).
- `Process All Files`: Applies previously calculated slant range correction & EGN to all loaded files at once. This will take some time depending on the amount of data (check console outputs).

## View Results
- Tick the `Reprocess File` option to apply slant range correction and EGN only to the selected file when viewing the results.
- `View Processed Data`: Initiates data viewer to inspect the raw input data, bottom line detection, slant range and EGN corrected data of the currently selected file.

## Georeferencing and image generation
- Tick `Use EGN corrected Data` if above processing steps should be applied, otherwise an ordinary waterfall image based on the raw data will be created
- `Dynamic Chunking` chooses number of pings within one chunk for georeferencing based on distance between GPS points. Only apply when GPS data are bad. If unticked, chunk size is 5 pings.
- `Apply Colormap`: Select from a range of colormaps; if unticked, greyscale values are used
- `Generate Geotiff`: Uses gdal to georeference data chunk wise and save to Geotiff
- `Generate Waterfall Image`: Generates a non-georeferenced png file
